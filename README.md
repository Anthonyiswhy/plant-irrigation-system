# Automatic Plant Irrigation System

A water-conserving irrigation system that only activates a water pump when soil moisture falls below a threshold. It displays data on an OLED and sounds a buzzer alert when watering begins.

### Features
- Soil moisture sensor controls pump
- OLED shows moisture + temp + humidity
- Buzzer plays tune during watering
- Prevents over-watering and saves water

### Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- Soil moisture sensor
- BME280 atmospheric sensor
- OLED (SSD1306)
- 5V water pump
- Relay module
- Buzzer

### Why I built it
I wanted to learn practical embedded electronics and environmental monitoring. It taught me sensor calibration, OLED graphics, relay control, and power management.
